/** Iterator facilitating group-wise iteration over two ore more levels.
  * Each level is represented by an inner iterator. Interactions between these
  * levels are handled internally thus the implementor just needs to define
  * the individual level iterators. Level iterator implementations will typically be
  * inner objects inheriting from the public inner traits of this trait.
  *
  * This trait is not graph-specific.
  *
  * @tparam A Simple or composite type of elements being subject to the iteration.
  *         For instance, a two-level iteration could expose just the elements of
  *         the inner loop or both the outer and the inner loop elements as a tuple.
  * @define LAZY To avoid an infinite loop on initialization time, `lazy` should be
  *         used when overriding.
